*Difference b/w Document and Window Object?
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
* Documnet Object:
   ---------------------------
	*The browser creates a Document Object Model of the page when a web page is loaded.
	* It is the root element that represents the html document.
	*The document object represents the whole html document as a tree of Objects(HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags).
	*Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object.
	*The document contains the contents of the page.
	*Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page
	*You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object directly as window is global object.


*Window Object:
 ------------------------
	*The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document.
	*where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.
	* It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy.
	*Window object has properties like browser history, location and the deviceâ€™s screen etc.
	* In case of multi tab browser, a window object represents a single tab, but some of its properties like innerHeight, innerWidth and methods like resizeTo() will affect the whole browser window.


*Note:
 ---------
	*The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods. Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior.
